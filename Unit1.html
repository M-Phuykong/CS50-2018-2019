            <p>
            There are four monomers that is essential for life to happen. And within these monomers, five main elements (Carbon,Nitrogen,Phosphorous,Hydrogen and Oxygen)
            The four monomers are:
                <ul>
                    <li> Carbohydrate (C H O) </li>
                    <li> Lipids  (C H O + P)</li>
                    <li> Proteins (C H O N) </li>
                    <li> Nucleic Acids (C H O N P)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2> Carbohydrate </h2>
            <p>
               Carbohydrate are macromolecules that consist in our daily diet such as bread. The monomer of Carbohydrate are "monosaccharide".
               Monosaccharide are made up out of carbon, hydrogen along with oxygen in a carbon fused ring. Some example of monosaccharide are glucose, fructose galactose, etc.
               When a monosaccharide is joined into two then it becomes a Disaccharide such as sucrose (glucose + fructose). If it's more than two monosaccharide then it would become a polysaccharide.
               Example of polysaccharide would be glycogen and starch, where both are complex chain of monosaccharide that is used to store energy in plant (starch) and animal (glycogen).

            <h2> Lipids </h2>
            <p>
                Lipids is an essential macromolecule for us to live as it helps organism to retain heat. Lipids has two monomers: glyceride and fatty acids. Both are which are made out of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
                Phospholipid are another type of lipid that has phosphorus in them, they are commonly found in the plasma membrane (cell membrane). Phospholipid are a special type of lipid because they are amphiphile, meaning that it is hydrophobic and hydrophilic.
                Due to its property, we can see why they make up for our cell membrane since they create a gap between two layer of them which means that they are able to control the flow of foreign substances

            <h2> Proteins </h2>
            <p>
                An important macromolecule that we need in order to live (very crucial) would be protein. We generally get out protein from meat whether if it’s beef, pork, chicken, etc.
                Protein itself is made out of many amino acids, which are monomer of protein. Amino acids are made out of Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen  and Nitrogen. When amino acids are joined together, they are held by a “peptide bond”.
                Protein itself has many uses in our body such as creating new enzyme, help fix tissue/muscle damage, release hormones and so on. An important example would be enzyme. Enzyme are catalyst that help speed up reaction without contributing to the reaction, it helps speed the reaction by lowering the Activation Energy.
                It is crucial for our body to create enzyme because without it, we wouldn’t break down food fast enough for our body to sustain itself.

            <h2> Nucleic Acids</h2>
            <p>
                The last macromolecule would be Nucleic Acid. It is made out of Carbon, Oxygen, Phosphorous, Nitrogen and Hydrogen. Its structure consist of a pentose-sugar (5-carbon sugar), one phosphate attached to it and one of the four nitrogenous base (A,T, C or G).
                An example of a nucleic acid would be our DNA and RNA where it is the blueprint of us. DNA are double stranded helix that contain different bases such as Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine. While RNA are single stranded helix that contain the base: Adenine, Uracil, Cytosine and Guanine.
                In a DNA, these bases are at one strand each of the helix and joining it from the other helix is its complementary pair base. An example would be if one strand contain the base “Adenine” then the complementary pair would be “Thymine” in the opposite strand.
